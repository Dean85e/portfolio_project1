### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

* When running the site through lighthouse report i noticed the performance score was 
  low (73), To fix this I reduced the size of hero image with Optimizilla's online service 
  this has pushed the sites performance score up to (92).

 
     
#### html

  * When validating the html through the official W3C validator I found some errors
    these errors were from nesting elements inside each other, I had one extra closing
    tag for a div in the about section and the contact section.

  * I went through the html and removed both said closing tags and ran the html
    through the validator again, this time no errors were found.
