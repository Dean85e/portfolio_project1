### Testing

  * I can confirm this website works in different browsers: Edge,Chrome,Safari and 
    Firefox.

  * I can confirm this site is responsive, looks and functions good on all standard
    screen sizes by using dev tools. 

  * I have confirmed the form validation works as it requires entry in all fields
    and will only accept an email in the email field.

  * I have checked the submit button works.

  * I have also checked that the button on the thank you page works and links back to 
    the main website.

### Bugs

     
#### html

  * When validating the html through the official w3c validator I found some bugs
    these errors were from nesting elements inside each other I had one extra closing
    tag for a div in the about section and contact section.

  * I went through the html and removed both said closing tags and ran the html
    through the validator, this time no errors were found.
